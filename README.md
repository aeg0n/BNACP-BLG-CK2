Better Norse and Celtic Portraits - A Better Looking Garbs Sub-Mod for CK2

## Introduction, Features and Acknowledgement

This mod is a subset of my personal tweaks to the famous [Better Looking Garbs Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242601880) by [Nendur](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nendur). Without his mod, this submod won't exist (And wouldn't work for that matter in all probability). 

On request of CK2 Reddit community, I am releasing part of those personal changes to the public.

What this mod basically does is, it revamps the Celtic and Norse portraits by using the base German model for faces while retaining their garb, hair, and other physical features making them different from Vanilla Celtics and Norse portraits. 

For example, before using the submod you see:

And after using the mod you see:
